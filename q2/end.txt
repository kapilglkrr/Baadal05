if more than 2 debits are happening at once.

In Two-Phase Commit, as in any asynchronous algorithm, process failure
and restart is easy to handle. Each process records its current state in
stable storage before sending any message while in that state. For example,
upon receipt of a Prepared message, the TM records in stable storage that
it has entered the preparing state and then sends the Prepare messages.
When a failed process is restarted, it can simply restore its state from stable
storage and continue executing the algorithm. Process failure and restart is
equivalent to the process pausing, which is permitted by an asynchronous
algorithm. Section 6.4 discusses in more detail what happens when a process
fails and restarts in our transaction commit protocols.
